"""
The goal of this file is to create a datasets.tsv file. 

The file has the following structure: 
Filename ExperimentName ReplicateName Genome RestrictionEnzyme

such as: 
mapped-hg19/SRR3141592/chunk0001.hdf5 K562 R1 hg19 HindIII
mapped-hg19/SRR3141592/chunk0002.hdf5 K562 R1 hg19 HindIII
mapped-hg19/SRR3141593/chunk0001.hdf5 K562 R1 hg19 HindIII
mapped-hg19/SRR3141593/chunk0002.hdf5 K562 R1 hg19 HindIII
mapped-hg19/SRR3141594/chunk0001.hdf5 K565 R2 hg19 HindIII
etc. 

Sometimes you will need more than 1000 lines in this file, and it may be a pain to create it manually. 
You can really do anything in any language to do this.

For (Rao, 2014) I had to write a parser of the spreadsheets which came with the paper, because 260 sequencing runs is too much to do manually. 
For many papers I use this template. 

This template will parse the file runs.tsv
That must be provided in the following format 

mapped-hg19/SRR3141592 K562 R1 hg19 HindIII
mapped-hg19/SRR3141593 K562 R1 hg19 HindIII
mapped-hg19/SRR3141594 K565 R2 hg19 HindIII
mapped-hg19/SRR3141595 HeLa R1 hg19 HindIII


etc.
